# BillSpliter

**About**
Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.

**Learning outcomes**
Work on your Python basics and take a look at more advanced data structures such as dictionaries. Develop an app for managing expenses during your next dine-out.
This project is a part of the following tracks
